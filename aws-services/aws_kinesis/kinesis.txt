# âš¡ Kinesis Integration

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The project integrates **Amazon Kinesis** to enable **real-time data streaming and processing**.
Kinesis acts as a **pipeline** where data flows in continuously from producers such as IoT devices, applications, or trading systems.

Instead of waiting for batch jobs, Kinesis allows us to process events the moment they arrive.
This ensures:

* **Low latency** (real-time insights).
* **Scalability** (can handle millions of records per second).
* **Reliability** (data retained for 24 hours by default, up to 7 days).

The streamed data is consumed by **AWS Lambda**, processed in real time, and then stored in **Amazon S3** for long-term storage, analytics, or machine learning workflows.

## ðŸ”„ Data Flow Explained

1. **Producer (Data Source)**

   * Applications, IoT devices, or bots send continuous event data (e.g., sensor readings, stock ticks, logs).
   * Each record has a payload and a partition key to decide which shard handles it.

2. **Kinesis Data Stream (Pipeline)**

   * Receives incoming records and temporarily stores them across **shards**.
   * Provides ordered, scalable, and fault-tolerant ingestion.

3. **AWS Lambda (Real-time Consumer)**

   * Subscribed to the Kinesis stream.
   * Automatically triggered when new records arrive.
   * Processes the data (e.g., anomaly detection, filtering, enrichment).

4. **Amazon S3 (Data Lake Storage)**

   * Processed or raw data is stored in S3.
   * Acts as a central data lake for further analytics, dashboards, or ML pipelines.
